# Frequently Asked Questions Regarding 6080 Assignment Marking

This markdown file aims to collate the questions and answers raised during the marking process of 6080 Assignments. These questions and answers should be applicable across most iterations of COMP6080.

The below questions are applicable as of 23T1.

## Assignment 1 + 2

TBA

## Assignment 3 - Vanilla Javascript + DOM manipulations

#### Is there a good `way` to format milestone comments?

[Use this website by Eric Pullukaran](https://astounding-strudel-501374.netlify.app/)

#### Progress.csv was not touched, does it matter?

No, it is just used as a guide for tutors to see what to focus on.

#### Should we penalise students for only displaying IDs instead of something more readable like names?

No unless explicitly stated in Assignment spec. But it will diminish their Usability marks.

#### What to do if a group's frontend just doesn't run/a milestone doesn't work at all?

The student will have to fix it post-marking. A late penalty of around 10% is applied per problem. This can be different depending on how much of the code was changed. When in doubt, confirm penalty with Hayden.

#### How do I apply a penalty?

If you need to apply a 30% penalty, then you would just need to apply a 15 hour late penalty. 1 hour === 2% penalty.

#### Is there a penalty for a website not written in English?

10% penalty is applied here. If the student scores more than 90%, then leave a comment asking student to redo in English.

#### How do we deal with student's websites that heavily relies on refreshing to get their website working?

A 30% penalty is applied since it's no longer a SPA.

#### Are we marking down for functionalities that don't get immediately reflected onto the frontend? (i.e., deleting a post is deleted from backend, but not on the frontend until refreshed).

Not marking it down in the milestone component, but will diminish usability.

#### Is there a style guide / other style related questions?

There is a style guide, which should be linked on the course website.

#### Not sure if website is not working because of your machine or not?

Ask other tutors to see if they can run the website.

#### What if the register functionality does not automatically log the user in?

Unless it's explicitly specified otherwise, it is fine for the user to not be automatically logged in after registering.

#### Are JavaScript classes fine?

Yes. Not to be confused with React Component Classes.

#### Are Vue.js, Axios allowed? And other prohibited things like async, await, jquery, some other external JS library, or multiple HTML files

No, and a 50% penalty is applied if any of the above used. For the case of jquery, if it's used minimally or is required for bootstrap functionality, then it is fine and excused.

#### Is DOMParser allowed?

No. Any implementation that has user writing HTML in strings in JavaScript is not allowed.

#### How to test for static offline feed?

Turn the backend off and see if their website still functions as specified in the spec (i.e., their feed still shows).

#### For Fragment based URL, do we expect the fragment to change when navigating between pages? Or should we only be testing if the user can parse the fragment and show the correct page?

No, unless explicitly asked in the Assignment spec.

## Assignment 4 - React

#### Is Cypress allowed for component testing?

Yes.

#### Are students allowed to use alerts for error popups?

If the spec doesn't ask for "X" or "Close" button, then it is allowed.
