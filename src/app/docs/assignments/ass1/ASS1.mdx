# Assignment 1 Marking

**Marking time**: You have 9 days to mark. Marking is due on DATE.

**Finding files**: You can lookup students code directly on gitlab, or alternatively I have done a bulk download into this zip attached. This zip will NOT include students who have extensions it was taken only 1 day after it was due.

**Marking Criteria**: You can find the marking criteria just at the bottom of the marking sheet.
Each question essentially has a compliance mark out of 1 (decimals are the way to go) and a code style mark out of 1

A good way to approach it is to give students 1/1 for a component unless they do something that is deserving of a mark loss. The marking criteria lists a bunch of things that may contribute to a mark loss. If you find something your students are doing that you think should lose them marks, just add it to the google sheet and let everyone know in the general slack channel

**Marking Consistency**: The first student that everyone here should mark is in the first column. Everyone is given time to mark this student and that way we can compare what you give them compare to what other tutors give them - and use this as early calibration.

**Marking time**: You should try and average about 13 minutes per student you mark. If you have issues hitting that average please just DM me üòç

**Late penalties**: I do rely on you to add the number of hours late to the spreadsheet. This is just the RAW hours late if they submitted (i.e. last master push) after the due date/time. Sometimes its easier just to do this in a sweep by copying and pasting zids for all students into a gitlab url and it takes a minute or two.
